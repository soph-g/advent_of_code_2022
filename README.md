# 🎄🎅❄️✨ Advent of Code 2022 ✨❄️🎅🎄

3rd year of Advent of Code in Ruby.

As always, doing this for fun. Goal is to get to working code as quickly as possible, I don't bother refactoring 🤘🏻

This year will be extra interesting as I haven't written ruby since March 😅

## Instructions
* Each day, copy the input into the relevant input file.
* Optional, create a test version of the input that you can use during build
* Can set the test flag to true/false to switch between test and real inputs

**To run:**
```
ruby lib/day_[number].rb
```

example:
```
ruby lib/day_01.rb
```
